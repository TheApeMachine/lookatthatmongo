# 🚀 Look At That Mon Go

An AI-powered MongoDB optimization platform that intelligently analyzes, optimizes, and monitors your MongoDB deployments.

## 🔍 Overview

Look At That Mon Go leverages artificial intelligence to transform MongoDB performance tuning from an art into a science. The platform continuously monitors your MongoDB clusters, identifies performance bottlenecks, recommends and applies optimizations, and validates their impact—all with minimal human intervention.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Collects detailed metrics on server performance, database statistics, collection usage, index efficiency, and query patterns.
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Analysis**: Uses advanced AI models to analyze performance data and identify optimization opportunities.
- 🔧 **Intelligent Optimization**: Automatically suggests and applies improvements to indexes, queries, schema design, and configuration settings.
- ✅ **Impact Validation**: Measures and reports the actual performance impact of each optimization.
- ↩️ **Automatic Rollback**: Safely reverts changes if they don't produce the expected improvements.
- 📈 **Historical Tracking**: Builds performance profiles over time to identify trends and recurring issues.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 🚀 Optimize underperforming MongoDB deployments
- 🛡️ Proactively prevent performance degradation
- 💰 Reduce operational costs by improving resource utilization
- 🤖 Automate routine database maintenance tasks
- 💡 Gain insights into application query patterns and database usage

## 🏁 Getting Started

```bash
# Set your MongoDB connection string
export MONGO_URI="mongodb://username:password@hostname:port/database"

# Run the optimizer
go run main.go
```
